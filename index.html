                            <p>The historically rich Turkish capital is situated in the heartland of Turkey, right in the center of Anatolia. Ankara is the second largest city after Istanbul, boasting many ancient monuments and archaeological sites dating from different eras. Ankara has been inhabited by many ancient civilizations over the years, which resulted in the formation of its modern culture, which was significantly influenced by its riveting past. The history of the city starts from the 3rd century BC when Ankara was the ancient capital of the Celtic state of Galatia. But even before that, modern-day Ankara was inhabited by the Hittites, Hattians, and Lydians, among others. Around 25 BC, Ankara served as a Roman capital under the rule of Augustus of the Roman province of Galatia. In the early years of the Ottoman Empire, Ankara became the capital of the Anatolia Eyalet, i.e., a former administrative province of the Ottoman Empire. It is evident that Ankara has a rich historical past, although it is often sadly disregarded by visitors traveling to Turkey. Some of its most notable attractions and monuments include the impressive Ankara Castle, the Temple of Augustus and Rome, the mausoleum of Atatürk Anıtkabir, and the Roman Baths in Çankiri Caddesi. Apart from its main town and suburbs, Ankara makes a great starting point for exploring the surrounding inland regions, such as Alacahöyük and Çorum. So, the most convenient way to discover Ankara without relying on bus and train timetables is by car. Our large fleet of vehicles in Ankara is composed of well-maintained cars such as SUVs, Jeeps, sedans, hatchbacks, and minivans, among others. By choosing the car that suits you best, you also choose unlimited flexibility, affordable prices, and 24/7 guaranteed safety. Try our Imperial services today!</p>

                            <p>The historically rich Turkish capital is situated in the heartland of Turkey, right in the center of Anatolia. Ankara is the second largest city after Istanbul, boasting many ancient monuments and archaeological sites dating from different eras. Ankara has been inhabited by many ancient civilizations over the years, which resulted in the formation of its modern culture, which was significantly influenced by its riveting past. The history of the city starts from the 3rd century BC when Ankara was the ancient capital of the Celtic state of Galatia. But even before that, modern-day Ankara was inhabited by the Hittites, Hattians, and Lydians, among others. Around 25 BC, Ankara served as a Roman capital under the rule of Augustus of the Roman province of Galatia. In the early years of the Ottoman Empire, Ankara became the capital of the Anatolia Eyalet, i.e., a former administrative province of the Ottoman Empire. It is evident that Ankara has a rich historical past, although it is often sadly disregarded by visitors traveling to Turkey. Some of its most notable attractions and monuments include the impressive Ankara Castle, the Temple of Augustus and Rome, the mausoleum of Atatürk Anıtkabir, and the Roman Baths in Çankiri Caddesi. Apart from its main town and suburbs, Ankara makes a great starting point for exploring the surrounding inland regions, such as Alacahöyük and Çorum. So, the most convenient way to discover Ankara without relying on bus and train timetables is by car. Our large fleet of vehicles in Ankara is composed of well-maintained cars such as SUVs, Jeeps, sedans, hatchbacks, and minivans, among others. By choosing the car that suits you best, you also choose unlimited flexibility, affordable prices, and 24/7 guaranteed safety. Try our Imperial services today!</p>
